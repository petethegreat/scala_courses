signals take an expression, and implement an apply method

class Signal[T]( expr: => T) {
    def apply(): T = ??? 
}

object Signal {
    def apply[T] (expr: => T) = new Signal(expr)
}

Signal(expr) will invoke the object's apply method, returning a new instance of the Signal class, with the supplied expression

Vars extend signals, such that they can be updated.

class Var[T] (expr: => T) extends Signal[T](expr) {
    def update(expr: => T): Unit = ???
}

object Var { 
    def apply[T](expr: => T) = new Var(expr)
}

moose = Var(expr)
moose.update(expr2)

## Syntatic sugar
moose() = expr2 is equivalent to moose.update(expr2), just as moose(expr) is syntatic sugar for moose.apply(expr)


signal maintains:
  - it's current value
  - the expression that defines the signal value
  - a set of observers - other signals that depend on value.
if signal changes, observers are re-evaluated.

How do we record dependencies?
