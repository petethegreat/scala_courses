\section{functional paradigms}


mutation - change some attribute while maintaining identity. For example, could define a polynomial class, then set a certain coefficient to a particular value.

functional programming - avoid mutation - use immutable variables (values)
take something and change it, resulting in something else.
minimise side effects

functional programming
restricted definition - no mutable variables, assignments, or imperative conttrol structures
wider sense - a functional programming language allows the construction of elegant programs that focus on fucntions

functions are first class functions
